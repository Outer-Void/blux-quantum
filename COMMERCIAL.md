# Commercial Licensing

BLUX Quantum is dual-licensed. You may use it under the open-source Apache License 2.0 in LICENSE-APACHE. Commercial use that goes beyond the Apache license requires a separate commercial agreement described in LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.

## When you need a commercial license

- Offering hosted or managed versions of BLUX Quantum for customers
- Integrating BLUX Quantum into internal proprietary systems at scale where the deployment is not governed by the Apache License 2.0
- Any redistribution, sublicensing, or monetization that is not explicitly allowed under Apache-2.0
